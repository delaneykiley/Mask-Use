    <p> This narrative visualization project explores data on the top grossing movies of all time. </p>
    <p>
      As a movie lover, I thought it would be interesting to dive deeper into some attributes of the highest-grossing movies. 
      The legend on the right helps to indicate just how many of these are concentrated in the recent past. 
      Viewers can also access more information on each film by mousing over the corresponding bar.

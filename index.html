<h1>Airbnb Listings Data Visualization</h1>

<p>This data visualization project explores listings data for New York City on Airbnb, a platform for finding places to stay around the world.
</p>

<p>I chose to focus on New York City for this project for a few reasons. I live there, so I have a personal interest. It is also the largest 
    city in the United States and a huge tourist destination, so while it would narrow the scope of the data it would also leave me with a large
    amount to analyze.
